    title: 'Why Your Ideas Are Suffering From Too Much Political Correctness',
    body: `Creativity is a team sport. Whether you are an extrovert or an introvert, when you are within a team, others can build on top of your ideas, and you can build on top of theirs. The quality of teamwork depends on the ability to do just that and have an open and honest debate of ideas. However, political correctness prevents us from pointing out flaws in other team members' ideas.

While historically brainstorming required you to initially defer judgment (during the divergence phase of brainstorming), it was later discovered that even early judgment helps in formulating great ideas within a team. When we are politically correct, we avoid judging altogether. We accept all ideas as "great" ideas, even if in our hearts and minds we know some of those are pretty stupid. As a result, we may end up having a very large number of ideas, but very few that are really good.

"There is no such thing as a stupid question" is one incarnation of political correctness. You are about to ask a question, knowing it might be a stupid one. You are not sure whether you should ask it or not, so you prefix it with "this might be a stupid question," to which you receive the almost immediate response "there is no such thing as a stupid question." Sounds familiar? And there lies the problem. You are going to ask your question, which, by the way, might very well be a stupid one. However, nobody will now tell you that your question was stupid. They can't. Not after the assurance you just got that your question cannot be stupid in any way, shape, of form. So, what do we do now? We have to treat your question (or idea) as a good one, and settle for mediocrity of the process.

For the team to be creative, true, and honest, true and honest judgment must be used. Some ideas may be stupid. Some questions may be stupid. Some of them are stupid at the time, but will reveal themselves as smart later on, and in a different context. How should you fight this urge to be politically correct, then?

1. Ask stupid questions
Be willing to ask stupid questions, suggest stupid ideas, and be told they are such. You need to feel comfortable enough to do that. Nobody expects you to have great questions and bright ideas only. Besides, you might find that what sounds stupid in your head gives someone else a much better idea. Don't hold back. Share, and be willing to accept the criticism. After all, what's the worst thing that will happen if you ask a stupid question?

2. Don't make promises you can't keep
When someone is reluctant from sharing an idea or asking a question because it might be stupid, don't make the "there is no such thing as a stupid question" promise. You may be wrong. Very wrong. You should respond with "what's the worst that can happen if you ask a stupid question?" Minimize the fear of proposing less-than-perfect ideas. You can also ask "what if we find this is a great question?"

3. Attack the idea, not the person
And then it happened. The other team member asked the question, and it was, in fact, stupid. Don't sugar-coat it. Don't say it was a great idea if it was mediocre at best. Say it was a bad idea. Say why. Don't tell your teammate he is stupid. Don't make them defensive, but offer direct and honest feedback. "Don't be mean when you say it..."

4. Build trust first
The willingness of a team member to be vulnerable and ask stupid questions or propose stupid ideas depends on trust, defined as "the safety in relationships." Before you ask team members to feel comfortable asking stupid questions, they need to know that you will not make fun of them personally. They need to know that what you say is what you mean. Trust takes time to build, but without it--you will never get over the fear of asking stupid questions. Very few people ever will.

5. Set ground rules
I found that setting ground rules at the beginning of a meeting helps a lot. A rule such as "nothing is off the table" will assure that team members will not hide controversial topics. Another rule such as "what happens here, stays here" will calm the fear of your stupid questions being put on display outside the team. Even a rule such as "stupid questions/ideas are welcome" would help. Use your imagination to put together a set of ground rules that will assure team members will be willing to share whatever potentially stupid idea or question they have with the rest. That's the only way the team will produce 1+1=3.

Now, do you have a stupid question?

    title: `Hillary Clinton's Shocking Rant: This Is How Much She Despises Americans in the Heartland`,
    body: `During her recent trip to India, Hillary Clinton told an Indian audience in Mumbai the reasons she lost the 2016 election. She said that Donald Trump's voters "hated black people getting rights and women getting jobs."  She claimed that she won the successful parts of the country and that Trump won the "backwards" areas.

"I won the places that represent two-thirds of America's gross domestic product," Clinton said. "So I won the places that are optimistic, diverse, dynamic, moving forward. And his whole campaign, 'Make America Great Again,' was looking backwards."\n Conservative commentator Erick Erickson wrote on his website, The Resurgent, despite Clinton's claims that Trump or his voters wouldn't want Indian-Americans succeeding, it was Trump who appointed Nikki Haley, an India-American as UN Ambassador, and it was Republican voters in South Carolina and Louisiana who elected Indian-Americans Nikki Haley and Bobby Jindal as governors respectively.

Erickson also wrote, "Well, she was finally willing to admit it. Speaking out of the country in India, Hillary Clinton let loose with a diatribe against the American Heartland."

He also said, "Her remarks dripped with contempt for Americans."

Since Clinton's loss in 2016, a number of Democrats have called for their party to move on from the election and focus on the future.

NOTE: This story has been updated. Earlier references to statements by Patty Solis Doyle and Rep. Joe Crowley were incorrect in their context.`,

    title: 'Why smoking weed could be good for you',
    body:`There are few subjects that can stir up stronger emotions among doctors, scientists, researchers, policy makers, and the public than medical marijuana. Is it safe? Should it be legal? Decriminalized? Has its effectiveness been proven? What conditions is it useful for? Is it addictive? How do we keep it out of the hands of teenagers? Is it really the \u201Cwonder drug\u201D that people claim it is? Is medical marijuana just a ploy to legalize marijuana in general?\r\n\r\nThese are just a few of the excellent questions around this subject, questions that I am going to studiously avoid so we can focus on two specific areas: why do patients find it useful, and how can they discuss it with their doctor?\r\n\r\nMarijuana is currently legal, on the state level, in 29 states, and in Washington, DC. It is still illegal from the federal government\u2019s perspective. The Obama administration did not make prosecuting medical marijuana even a minor priority. President Donald Trump promised not to interfere with people who use medical marijuana, though his administration is currently threatening to reverse this policy. About 85% of Americans support legalizing medical marijuana, and it is estimated that at least several million Americans currently use it.\r\n\r\nMarijuana without the high\r\nLeast controversial is the extract from the hemp plant known as CBD (which stands for cannabidiol) because this component of marijuana has little, if any, intoxicating properties. Marijuana itself has more than 100 active components. THC (which stands for tetrahydrocannabinol) is the chemical that causes the \u201Chigh\u201D that goes along with marijuana consumption. CBD-dominant strains have little or no THC, so patients report very little if any alteration in consciousness.\r\n\r\nPatients do, however, report many benefits of CBD, from relieving insomnia, anxiety, spasticity, and pain to treating potentially life-threatening conditions such as epilepsy. One particular form of childhood epilepsy called Dravet syndrome is almost impossible to control, but responds dramatically to a CBD-dominant strain of marijuana called Charlotte\u2019s Web. The videos of this are dramatic.\r\n\r\nUses of medical marijuana\r\nThe most common use for medical marijuana in the United States is for pain control. While marijuana isn\u2019t strong enough for severe pain (for example, post-surgical pain or a broken bone), it is quite effective for the chronic pain that plagues millions of Americans, especially as they age. Part of its allure is that it is clearly safer than opiates (it is impossible to overdose on and far less addictive) and it can take the place of NSAIDs such as Advil or Aleve, if people can\u2019t take them due to problems with their kidneys or ulcers or GERD.\r\n\r\nIn particular, marijuana appears to ease the pain of multiple sclerosis, and nerve pain in general. This is an area where few other options exist, and those that do, such as Neurontin, Lyrica, or opiates are highly sedating. Patients claim that marijuana allows them to resume their previous activities without feeling completely out of it and disengaged.\r\n\r\nAlong these lines, marijuana is said to be a fantastic muscle relaxant, and people swear by its ability to lessen tremors in Parkinson\u2019s disease. I have also heard of its use quite successfully for fibromyalgia, endometriosis, interstitial cystitis, and most other conditions where the final common pathway is chronic pain.\r\n\r\nMarijuana is also used to manage nausea and weight loss, and can be used to treat glaucoma. A highly promising area of research is its use for PTSD in veterans who are returning from combat zones. Many veterans and their therapists report drastic improvement and clamor for more studies, and for a loosening of governmental restrictions on its study. Medical marijuana is also reported to help patients suffering from pain and wasting syndrome associated with HIV, as well as irritable bowel syndrome and Crohn\u2019s disease.\r\n\r\nThis is not intended to be an inclusive list, but rather to give a brief survey of the types of conditions for which medical marijuana can provide relief. As with all remedies, claims of effectiveness should be critically evaluated and treated with caution.\r\n\r\nTalking with your doctor\r\nMany patients find themselves in the situation of wanting to learn more about medical marijuana, but feel embarrassed to bring this up with their doctor. This is in part because the medical community has been, as a whole, overly dismissive of this issue. Doctors are now playing catch-up, and trying to keep ahead of their patients\u2019 knowledge on this issue. Other patients are already using medical marijuana, but don\u2019t know how to tell their doctors about this for fear of being chided or criticized.\r\n\r\nMy advice for patients is to be entirely open and honest with your physicians and to have high expectations of them. Tell them that you consider this to be part of your care and that you expect them to be educated about it, and to be able to at least point you in the direction of the information you need.\r\n\r\nMy advice for doctors is that whether you are pro, neutral, or against medical marijuana, patients are embracing it, and although we don\u2019t have rigorous studies and \u201Cgold standard\u201D proof of the benefits and risks of medical marijuana, we need to learn about it, be open-minded, and above all, be non-judgmental. Otherwise, our patients will seek out other, less reliable sources of information; they will continue to use it, they just won\u2019t tell us, and there will be that much less trust and strength in our doctor-patient relationship. I often hear complaints from other doctors that there isn\u2019t adequate evidence to recommend medical marijuana, but there is even less scientific evidence for sticking our heads in the sand.`,

    title: 'Feminism Is Cancer!',
    body : `Feminism is cancer because it is built on a lie. Actually, it is built on a whole pyramid of lies, but there is one gigantic one at its base.

Here it is in its most diabolical form. The author is Ludwig Feuerbach, his translator the novelist George Eliot, the work his Essence of Christianity, published in English in 1854:
But here it is also essential to observe, and this phenomenon is an extremely remarkable one, characterising the very core of religion, that in proportion as the divine subject is in reality human, the greater is the apparent difference between God and man; that is, the more, by reflection on religion, by theology, is the identity of the divine and human denied, and the human, considered as such, is depreciated.... To enrich God, man must become poor; that God may be all, man must be nothing....
The monks made a vow of chastity to God; they mortified the sexual passion in themselves, but therefore they had in heaven, in the Virgin Mary, the image of woman—an image of love. They could the more easily dispense with real women in proportion as an ideal woman was an object of love to them. The greater the importance they attached to the denial of sensuality, the greater the importance of the heavenly virgin for them: she was to them in the place of Christ, in the stead of God.
Do you see what Feuerbach did here? Do you see how he foreshadowed almost every argument made ever since about the meaning of Mary, God’s mother? About how she was, in effect, the monks’ pin-up girl because they were deprived of the company of actual women? About how, whatever devotion they had to her, it must have been about sex—and putting a woman in place of God?

Do you understand why this argument is literally diabolical? Do you understand the pride in insisting that God takes away from man his identity, making man poor so that God—in Feuerbach’s formulation, the abstraction of all human values projected onto the imaginary object which is then imagined as acting as a subject back on man—might become rich? Do you understand how it undercuts everything in the proper relationship between the sexes, not to mention between God and man? Satan himself could not have phrased it better—or more deceptively.

Do you see the lie yet? No? Let’s fast forward then to 1949.

Here it is, even more explicitly, in the founding manifesto of modern feminism, Simone de Beauvoir’s The Second Sex:
Paradoxically, it was Christianity that was to proclaim the equality of man and woman on a certain level. Christianity detests the flesh in her; if she rejects the flesh, she is, like him, a creature of God, redeemed by the Savior: here she can take her place beside males, among those souls guaranteed celestial happiness....
Of course, the divine Savior who brings about Redemption is male; but humanity must cooperate in its own salvation, and perversely it will be called upon to manifest its submissive goodwill in its most humiliated figure. Christ is God; but it is a woman, the Virgin Mother, who reigns over all human creatures. Yet only marginal sects restore the great goddesses’ ancient privileges to the woman. The Church expresses and serves a patriarchal civilization where it is befitting for woman to remain annexed to man. As his docile servant, she will also be a blessed saint....
For the first time in the history of humanity, the mother kneels before her son; she freely recognizes her inferiority. The supreme masculine victory is consummated in the cult of Mary: it is the rehabilitation of woman by the achievement of her defeat. Ishtar, Astarte, and Cybele were cruel, capricious, and lustful; they were powerful; the source of death as well as life, in giving birth to men, they made them their slaves. With Christianity, life and death now depended on God alone....
Nature is originally bad, but powerless when countered with grace. Motherhood as a natural phenomenon confers no power. If woman wishes to overcome the original stain in herself, her only alternative is to bow before God, whose will subordinates her to man. And by this submission she can assume a new role in masculine mythology....
As a servant, woman is entitled to the most splendid apotheosis.
Yet again, it is God who is the thief, here, however, acting in the service of “patriarchal civilization,” according to which the only value—horror of horrors!—that women have is in being an object for men. Mary supplants Christ in reigning over human creatures, but God still reigns over her, the Son forcing her to kneel before him. Christianity—or so de Beauvoir insists—is the author of the lie keeping women in second place. The pagan goddesses were divine in their own right, enslaving men even as they gave birth to them. Mary, on the other hand, is a mere servant in her elevation.

You believe de Beauvoir, don’t you? You believe that Christianity has been bad for women. You believe that Mary, in humbling herself before God, lost everything that made her a potential model for women. You believe that Christianity stripped the goddesses of their rightful womanhood—and that Christianity honored women only insofar as they were subordinated to—or became like—men, rational and purified of the flesh.

Of course you do. Erich Neumann said so in The Great Mother, his magisterial account of the archetypal feminine published in 1955. Here is the lie again, in Neumann’s words:
Thus the spiritual power of Sophia [Wisdom] is living and saving; her overflowing heart is wisdom and food at once. The nourishing life that she communicates is a life of the spirit and of transformation, not one of earthbound materiality.
As spirit mother, she is not, like the Great Mother of the lower phase, interested primarily in the infant, the child, and the immature man, who cling to her in these stages. She is rather a goddess of the Whole, who governs the transformation from the elementary to the spiritual level; who desires who men knowing life in all its breadth, from the elementary phase to the phase of spiritual transformation.
In the patriarchal development of the Judaeo-Christian West, with its masculine, monotheistic trend toward abstraction, the goddess, as a feminine figure of wisdom, was disenthroned and repressed. She survived only secretly, for the most part on heretical and revolutionary bypaths.
There it is again! The claim that Christianity—or, rather, the Judaeo-Christian West—was “patriarchal,” hellbent (to coin a phrase) on repressing the “feminine figure of wisdom.” Elsewhere—Neumann points to “the Orient”—the goddess managed to hold her own. But here in the West, she was pushed into the shadows by the “masculine, monotheistic trend toward abstraction” (see Feuerbach, above) to return, according to Neumann, only as a witch.

Have you spotted the lie yet? Here’s a hint: it has to do with God.

How do you know that Christianity is “patriarchal” and concerned more with monotheistic abstraction than with the flesh? How do you know that it suppressed the feminine and made Mary a figure of submission for women? How do you know the only reason medieval monks devoted themselves to Mary was because they were not allowed to have sex? How do you know that Mary’s submission to God represents the victory of the masculine over the feminine? How do you know that Christianity made women the second sex?

I’ll tell you. Because enlightened idiots like Feuerbach and de Beauvoir and Neumann told you so—and lies, as Satan knows, are always easier to believe than the truth.

*

The medieval Christians whom modern philosophers, feminists, and psychoanalysts loved to despise had a much more sophisticated understanding of the feminine—and of God—than their cultured despisers ever allowed. Not only did they not “disenthrone and repress” the Virgin; neither did they use her as a kind of porn. (They had God for that.)

Quite the reverse. Medieval Christians put Mary on a magnificent throne, elevated high above every creature in Creation, because she herself was a throne for God. “Come, my chosen one,” they imagined Christ saying to her, “and I will place my throne in you because the king has desired your beauty.” And what a throne she was!

“O truly blessed, O truly stable throne,” the Franciscan preacher Conrad of Saxony (d. 1279) hailed her in his popular Mirror of the Blessed Virgin Mary, a commentary on the Ave Maria,
just as it is said in 3 Kings 8:13: Thy most firm throne for ever. This most high throne is in the intellect, raised up on the affections; it is most high over men, raised up over angels.... On this throne, Mary, on this throne, I say, of her mind, the Lord was seated, and the house of her body was full of the majesty of the Incarnate Word.... Therefore, it is said in 3 Kings 8:11-12: The glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord. Then Solomon said: “The Lord said that he would dwell in a cloud.” Therefore, the house of the Lord, Mary, was filled with the glory of the divine majesty by the cloud of the humanity assumed by God; that cloud, I say, of which it is said in Ecclesiasticus 43:24: The medicine of all is in the speedy coming of a cloud. And again in Ecclesiasticus 50:6: [He shone in his days] as the morning star in the midst of a cloud. For like the star in a cloud is the Word in the flesh assumed by him.
Far from rejecting the flesh assumed from the Virgin—as de Beauvoir would have it—God reveled in it, taking her flesh and glorifying it in the flesh of her Son.

Likewise, far from denying the spiritual power of the feminine—as Neumann would have it—medieval Christians like Conrad and his contemporaries Richard of St. Laurent (d. ca. 1250) and pseudo-Albert the Great (the heroes of my new book on Mary, if you haven’t guessed) identified her explicitly as Wisdom and the Mother of Wisdom, her mind the most perfect mirror of the divine in which the Lord took up his throne.

In pseudo-Albert’s words:
That the most blessed Virgin was wiser than any other creature, is indicated by the fact that the book which is entitled Wisdom is especially interpreted concerning her: the Church interprets what is said of the Lord’s wisdom as if it is said of her, as is evident in the epistles [that is, the lessons for the Office and Mass] which are read of her. In wisdom, however, there is nothing of stupidity or ignorance: therefore the most blessed Virgin was full of wisdom. But in faith, wisdom is not full, but only in part, as it is said: For we know in part, and we prophesy in part (I Corinthians 13:9). Therefore, the most blessed Virgin did not have faith, but full knowledge.
And what did the Virgin know? According to pseudo-Albert, everything: all the arts, all the sciences, the whole of the law, both canon and civil; everything in the book of the Sentences (the textbook of theology used in the schools); everything pertaining to the Trinity, to angels, and to the six days of Creation; everything pertaining to the Incarnation of the Word, the sacraments, and the Resurrection, to the past, present, and future, and to the kingdom of God. (How’s that for an empowered woman? STEM fanatics take note.)

Indeed, Richard insisted, so perfectly was Mary illuminated by the Divinity whose dwelling she was, that
...in God, so to speak, she was deified (deificata), made a participant in divine eternity, without corners or turnings. From behind [Richard is commenting on the description of Solomon’s throne, 3 Kings 10:18-19] means the end of the body: because in life there is no perfect happiness, but only in the life to come. Then the likeness of the divine image (divine imagines similitudo) will shine forth in our mind or understanding through our memory, reason, and will.
Feuerbach would insist that God exists only insofar as human beings, having consciousness of themselves as a species, see themselves acted upon by the object of their abstraction. In his words:
The divine being is nothing else than the human being, or, rather, the human nature purified, freed from the limits of the individual man, made objective—i.e. contemplated and revered as another, a distinct being.
In Feuerbach’s thinking, God exists insofar as the attributes of human nature exist; man mirrors God because God mirrors man. For Richard, it was Mary who was the most perfect mirror, the one in whom Wisdom saw Wisdom made flesh:
Mary is an unspotted mirror for the souls of the faithful, in which they ought to gaze continuously. For so great is her purity that anything greater [than she] under God cannot be thought, just as blessed Anselm says; for she was worthy to conceive him, as Jerome says, who reformed in us the image deformed by the old Adam, when through her love and obedience the wax of human nature was made warm and pliable and was impressed once again with the seal, that is, the Son of God, in her virginal womb.
Mary, the Mother of the Word, was herself the most perfect human being because in her body and soul was realized the most perfect reflection of the divine. Far from being subjected to her Son by her love and obedience, Mary became his most perfect likeness. As woman, in other words, Mary realized—made real—God.

Some pin-up girl, eh?

*

This is the great lie of feminism, the cancer at the heart of modernity: the claim that Christianity made less of humanity, made less of woman in its meditation on the relationship of Mary to God. All the lies on which the modern critique of the “patriarchy” rests are metastases of this great cancer.

The lie that in Christianity the created, material world was considered evil or worthless. The lie that in Christianity only the masculine virtues were valued. The lie that because God became incarnate as a man motherhood was demeaned. The lie that God demands our subjection because Mary humbled herself to serve the Lord.

No wonder the feminists are so angry. Everything they believe about the relationship between women and men, humanity and God, is based on a lie about Mary’s relationship with her Son.

I wonder where that lie came from. Or from whom.`,

  title: 'EA worse than hitler',
  body: `
  Gaming was alight with rage and burning pitchforks coming towards the release of EA’s Star Wars Battlefront 2 in November which caused the infamous “sense of pride and accomplishment” Reddit comment in response to the backlash that their loot box system and unlocking of in-game rewards had caused. And while at the time EA and game developer DICE pulled back the reins a bit, we lie here in the same situation as loot boxes emerge from the rug they’ve been hiding under for the last couple of months. Battlefront brought a wide range of questions about the gaming industry as a whole in November, and has left many in the know wondering how to get the sour taste out of their mouth. Loot boxes are becoming a staple of the market, but it’s a question of why this has happened, and where we see loot boxes going in the future, as they seem to be more and more of a feature in our favourite games.

  Bit of context first and foremost – what is a loot box? If you’ve happened to take up a sudden interest in gaming upon seeing this article, you probably have no idea what a “loot box” is. A loot box is a virtual item in games that you can purchase using real life money in most cases, or spend a large amount of time playing the game in order to get one, and it gives that player a random set of rewards – normally cosmetic, so your character looks especially bitchin’. Well that doesn’t sound overly bad, does it? Where we are now though doesn’t reflect the original purpose at all. Free to play games were the first to start using loot boxes, and contents varied between the simple cosmetic purpose as a way of generating money to allowing loot boxes to give items that would give one player an advantage over another.

  This is where everyone should kind of stop and say “ehhhhhhh what?” You can pay for loot boxes that may give you a chance to be better than another player regardless of skill because you either (a) paid money for loot boxes, or (b) played longer. The ‘play longer’ part is okay – if I pour more time into a game I should be rewarded for my time and dedication, sure! But when real money gets involved, the situation becomes sticky; right now it isn’t the same as when this came into being. The argument that it’s okay to pay to have an advantage did have some merit when it first came into being – if we look at free to play games, where all of this started, someone or a group of people spent hours upon hours so that you can play a game for free. You’ve paid nothing to get access to this game, so if I were to spend €20 on it to give back in some way, and I get a bonus for that, then it’s a bit of a win-win for myself and the developer.

  Context is key though, and while I can argue it isn’t a mortal sin to have loot boxes that give a competitive advantage in free to play games, the second you are obliged to put a single cent into a game you’ve already purchased, just to actually play it, then everything changes. Probably one of the earliest instances of a successful loot box system in a paid game is again an EA published game in the form of top football sim FIFA. FIFA is an annualised franchise for EA, where every year they update team rosters, jerseys, etc., and most importantly fix what they messed up the year before by inadvertently messing something else up – ‘but please give over your €70 anyway’. And something that has become the main focus and staple of each release is FIFA Ultimate Team. Introduced in 2010, Ultimate Team allows you to create your own team of players from most leagues through buying player packs. Better players, however, are rarer – for example, for every Ronaldo there’s probably 100,000 Shrewsbury Town players. You have to buy packs using either coins, which are earned in-game for playing matches and running drills, mostly, but you can buy packs using FIFA points, which can only be purchased using real money. So if you want Ronaldo on your team you could grind for coins for a nearly infinite amount of time, and not even get him, or quickly pump money into the game until you get him. In saying that, you probably won’t get Ronaldo regardless, because he’s so rare, but it’s the carrot on a stick approach when you know he’s there, and forking over cash is the easier, quicker option.

  When it comes to Ultimate Team there wasn’t a massive backlash against it, maybe due to the fact that the whole game mode is designed around being random, and that FIFA is based so much off of player skill that even if you have the best combination of players possible you could still lose to a more skilled player. Regardless, Ultimate Team was not a speed bump on the loot box road. It’s quite telling, the effect that this mode had on EA’s profits, as very quickly Ultimate Team became a staple and ‘poster boy’ for every sports game that they possess. Last year it was estimated that EA generates $800 million from just the Ultimate Team modes across its sports franchises, and it was just something everyone eventually took for granted – but this should be considered wrong, right? If I pay for a product it’s now mine, I own it, you can’t do anything about it. And that’s still true here, but it’s like “oh! You do own it, butttttt you’re not going to have the best experience possible, so you should totally spend more money!”

  And this brings me onto Star Wars Battlefront 2, and why it took the model FIFA had created but applied it in such a manner that didn’t translate. Firstly, I think everyone should take into account how much money EA must have spent so they could get exclusive rights to publishing any Star Wars game, so obviously they want to make a profit out of that, and have to fire on all corporate cylinders so they can take our cash. I would think, in an effort to try and maximise all the revenue they could, they included loot boxes. And sure why wouldn’t they? Call of Duty has been doing it for two years at this stage, Destiny implemented it nearly three years ago, and Overwatch popularised it in a way that it was all a-okay to spend money on this – but it comes back to advantages: I might have a cool looking red weapon, for instance, or my character can do the Carlton dance, but you can still shoot me dead at the same rate regardless of you spending loads on loot boxes or not. Battlefront 2 took a different approach by saying hey, here’s a loot box, and when you open it you’ll get something that will give you quicker cooldowns, or the ability to shoot rockets and throw grenades faster – suddenly we’ve gone from nice weapons skins and getting good players in a sports game to literally being able to be better at a game because you spent more money than someone else, making it difficult for them to compete.

  We roll back to the question I posed at the start: is it fair for someone to spend more money on a game to gain advantage, and we just accept that? The only answer is god no. It is just so manipulative of your customer that it is impossible to enjoy a product fully without pouring an infinite amount of extra money into a game just so you can unlock all the content. I would argue that loot boxes have been so anti-consumer that it’s too late to reverse the damage, so what I’m trying to accomplish here is to: (a) advise us, as gamers and consumers, to avoid another Star Wars Battlefront 2 situation, and (b) facing facts about the industry. The money that loot boxes make is ridiculous, one only needs to look at the previously quoted $800 million figure on the Ultimate Team revenue to know this fad is going nowhere, even, unfortunately, only gaining more traction as we get more and more used to it.

  I don’t think there would be enough pages in this newspaper to cover the issues with loot boxes beyond what I’ve covered from a consumer perspective. I didn’t even touch on the idea of gambling, how loot boxes affect the psyche of children, the negative effect on the quality of games and the prospect of government legislation worldwide comparing loot boxes to gambling. Loot boxes have been creeping into gaming in an omnipresent fashion, and it wasn’t until we got force smacked in the face by Star Wars that we realised what happened to the industry. Gaming publishers (EA, Activision, etc.) have the upper hand in this where they understand how this works, and how to make money from it, and to bring it back to Star Wars, it doesn’t mean we can’t rebel against it; it may seem like there’s no point, but rebellions are built on hope (possibly the cheesiest line I’ve ever put in this paper in my two years of writing).
